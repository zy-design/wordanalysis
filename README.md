The project is established to assist the research of the paper. It mainly uses Jieba to segment words, xlwt generates word frequency analysis result file, and wordcloud draws word cloud. This project is relatively simple, and it is also a small exercise for the first time to get involved in Python 3.8. There are many temporary loopholes. The partners who need to use can download and deploy them by themselves. In addition, I will deploy them on the server in a few days website

该项目为了辅助论文研究而建立，主要利用jieba进行分词，xlwt生成词频分析结果文件，wordcloud绘制词云，本项目比较简单，也是自己初涉python 3.8版本的一个小练习，暂时漏洞比较多，需要使用的小伙伴可以自行下载部署使用，另外过些天我将部署在服务器上，会同步放上网址
